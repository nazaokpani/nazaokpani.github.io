<h2> CALABAR CARNIVAL </h2>
<p> Calabar Carnival festival in Nigeria, also tagged " Africa's Biggest Street Party", was created as part of the vision of making the Cross River State , Nigeria, the number one tourist destination for Nigerians and tourists all over the world. The carnival which begins every 1 December and lasts until 31 December has boosted the cultural mosaic of Nigeria people while entertaining millions of spectators within and outside the State, and boosting industry for all stakeholders.
    </p>
The Calabar Carnival has come a long way. It started in 2004, when the governor of Cross River State , Mr Donald Duke , had a vision of making the state a hub for tourism and hospitality in Nigeria and Africa. [1] The Carnival presents a perfect platform from brand visibility for consumer and market awareness. "According to Osima-Dokubo, the carnival aimed to include more aspects of local heritage and culture and at the same time strengthen the capacity of the locals to participate in an economically beneficial way." Recently, Cross River State has become the pride of Nigeria in the areas of tourism ,
carnivals and hospitality .</p>
<p>
The programme of the event at the carnival are drafted each year by the committee in charge of tourism and cultural activities and new initiatives are introduced every year. In December 2009, Carnival Committee organized "Carnival Cup 2009", a football competition amongst the five competing carnival bands - Seagull, Passion 4, Masta Blasta, Bayside and Freedom. The Festival also included music performance from both local and international artists, the annual Calabar Carnival, Boat regatta, Fashion shows, Christmas Village, traditional dances and the annual Ekpe Festival is a yearly events that brings in thousands of tourists.
Other activities lined up for the year according to their work plan, include the second edition of Essay Writing Competition which will involve both secondary school and tertiary students, and this will commence in few weeks. These competitions are aimed at resuscitating the reading culture amongst the youths of the State as well as inculcating the carnival
culture .</p>
<p>
The event has hosted top Nigerian musicians, Nollywood Actors, 
Politicians and international artists. Over the last 4 years 
international artists like, the late Lucky Dube , Akon, Fat Joe ,
Young Jeezy, Nelly , Kirk Franklin , and many more has thrilled the 
large crowd of Nigerians and tourist from outside the country. Due to 
large crowd and fans that Nigerians artist carries, 2013 Calabar Carnival 
was focused on Nigerian artist.</p>

<h2> CROSS RIVER NATIONAL PARK </h2>
<p> The Cross River National Park is a national park of Nigeria, located 
    in Cross River State, Nigeria. There are two separate sections, 
    Okwangwo (established 1991) and Oban (established 1988). The park 
    has a total area of about 4,000 km 2 , most of which consists of 
    primary moist tropical rainforests in the North and Central parts, 
    with mangrove swamps on the coastal zones. Parts of the park belong 
    to the Guinea-Congolian region, with a closed canopy and scattered 
    emergent trees reaching 40 or 50 meters in height.</p> 
<p> The park has one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and has been 
    identified as a biodiversity hot spot. Sixteen primate species 
    have been recorded in the park. Rare primates include
common chimpanzees , drills and (in Okwangwo) Cross River gorillas. 
Another primate, the gray-cheeked mangabey, seems to have recently 
 become extinct in the area. 
Both divisions of the park are threatened by
illegal logging , slash and burn farming and poaching. Eco-tourism may 
support efforts to preserve the park fauna. [5] Assisting villagers in 
buffer zones to practice sustainable forestry also holds promise. <p>
    </p> 
The park was first proposed in 1965, but serious planning did not start 
until 1988. The
World Wide Fund for Nature - UK played a leading role for the plan to 
establish the park in two divisions separated by farmland and the Cross 
River valley, with a budget of $49.9 million. The plan envisaged 
villagers in the buffer zone being involved in running the park and 
being given development aid.
The Cross River National Park (CRNP) was established by Federal Ministry 
Government Decree in 1991, with the Cross River gorilla chosen as the 
theme animal. The original plan was not fully implemented, and the 
park established in 1991 only included existing forest reserves. After 
a small amount of initial aid, the funding dried up and the villagers 
became hostile to the park administration. An amending decree in 1999 
converted the Nigerian National Park Service, which runs the park, into 
a paramilitary outfit with increased powers. </p> 
<p> The Nigeria National Park Service is an agency of the Federal 
    Ministry of Environment, Housing & Urban Development. The Cross 
    River National Park is headed by a Director under the guidance of 
    a Park Management Committee. The park management has established 
    a station at Kanyang as a base for primate research and eco-tourism. 
    The Butatong Divisional Head Office, established with assistance from 
    the European Union and the World Wildlife Fund provides a base for 
    rangers patrolling the Okwa and Okwangwo sectors of the Okwangwo 
    division.</p>
<p> The park has four departments: Park Protection and Conservation, 
    Ecotourism, Park Engineering and Maintenance, and Finance and 
    Administration. In 2010, 250 of the total 320 personnel worked in 
    Park Protection and Conservation, mostly male due to the rigors of 
    the job, based at twelve ranger stations. This number is inadequate 
    given the size of the territory to be patrolled. Despite attempts at 
    training, many of the rangers are poorly qualified and are 
    dissatisfied with pay, equipment, motivation and career prospects.</p> 

<h2> UPPER ORASHI FOREST RESERVE</h2>
<p>One of the best bird-watching spots in the country, the Upper Orashi Forest Reserve is situated close to Ikodi Village in Ahoada Local Government Area of the state.

lesser honey guide, gaboonwoodpecker, blacked-capped yellow warbler, 
yellow-chinned sunbird, and white-breasted Negro finch among others.</p>
<h2> STATUE OF KING JAJA OF OPOBO</h2>
<p> Jaja of Opobo (full name: Jubo Jubogha; 1821–1891) was the first known Nigerian richest man, nationalist, a merchant prince and the founder of Opobo city-state which now forms part of Nigeria`s River State. Jaja whose real name was Mbanaso Okwaraozurumbaa was also a savvy political and military strategist, brought to the Bonny Kingdom as a slave, who was perhaps the most troublesome thorn in the flesh of 19th-century British imperial ambition in southern Nigeria.
Jubo Jubogba, also known as Jo Jo Ubam by the Igbo and as Jaja of Opobo, 
first, by the Europeans and later by most people, was born about 1821 at 
Úmuduruõha, Amaigbo village in the Orlu district, now Imo State of 
Eastern Nigeria (Isichei 1976:98). At birth he was given a native Igbo 
name Mbanaso Okwaraozurumba and was the third son of his parents, the 
Okwaraozurumba.</p>
<p> According to different oral sources, Jaja was sold into slavery in the Niger Delta under circumstances which are far from clear. One version of the oral traditions says that he was sold because, as a baby, he cut the upper teeth first, an abominable phenomenon in traditional Igbo society. Another version claims that he was captured and sold by his father's enemy. Regardless, he was bought by Chief Iganipughuma Allison of Bonny, by far the most powerful city-state on the Atlantic coast of Southeastern Nigeria before the rise of Opobo.
By 1891 British political intrigue had resulted in the death of King Jaja 
in exile.</p> <p>The period between 1891-mid 1893 left Opobo and King 
    Jaja dynasty on trial. But the chiefs of Opobo spectacularly managed 
    Opobo Kingdom until a new successor was named. He was Prince Sunday 
    Jaja. (1893 1915).The Opobo to which Chief Sunday was to 
        rule had not markedly altered in some respects from King Jaja 
        days including the period of his exile. Trade was still 
        transacted in the traditional manner, with the chiefs acting 
        as middlemen between the hinterland suppliers and the European 
        supercargoes. Chief Sundays reign marked remarkable economic and 
        political stability in Opobo.</p>
<p>The administration of Opobo Town politically and judiciary, was by a 
    British Council, Civil and criminal offences were reported to, and 
    investigated by him, town and home matters, including petty squabble 
    between individuals were referred to him. The council exercised the 
    power of imposing fine and or sentencing to terms of imprisonment. 
    An appeal against a judgment of the consul was lodged with the 
    consul general who on review at Calabar either confirmed, amended, 
    or annulled the judgment.</p>
<p>In August, 1894 King Sunday Jaja as king of Opobo together with his 
    chiefs granted the existing site to the Niger delta pastorate church 
    the site on which the St. Paul church and other building now stand. 
    The religious festivals for the ancestors were still performed 
    regularly; the owuogbo cult still retained its hold both as an 
    important acculturative instrument and as a vital arm of government. 
    Although Christianity had gained a foot hold, the adherents remained 
    few and inconsequential.</p>

<h2> KWALE GAME RESERVE</h2>
<p>The Kwale Game Reserve is located in the coastal part of Kwale in 
    Delta State. It is a rainforest vegetation and swamps full of 
    reptiles and water animals – red river hog, sitatunga, and 
    freshwater cum pond water fish.</p>

<h2> MUNGO PARK HOUSE </h2>
<p>Mungo Park House was erected by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886. 
    The Kwale Game Reserve is located in the coastal part of Kwale in 
    Delta State. It is a rainforest vegetation and swamps full of 
    reptiles and water animals – red river hog, sitatunga, and freshwater 
    cum pond water fish. It was built to keep alive the memory of Mungo 
    Park, a Briton who ‘discovered the source of the River Niger’. 
    But sadly enough, he died in 1806 where his boat somersaulted 
    somewhere in new Bussa, Niger State.</p>
<p>And for this singular act, the RNC members, mostly made up of traders 
that included that Lander Brothers, erected the building and named it 
after Mungo Park, as a mark of honour, being the first English explorer 
that attempted to discover the source of the River Niger. Thus, Asaba 
became the administrative headquarters of the Southern Protectorate, 
while Lokoja served as the military headquarters.</p>
<p> The long winding Nnebisi road in the historic city of Asaba holds 
    fond memories for residents of the 'big heart.' It is reputed to be 
    named after one of the founders of Asaba. It is a commercial beehive 
    that hosts the now rested Asaba textile mills, the Grand Hotel, 
    monuments attesting to the presence of colonial overlords in the pre 
    independence era, and other majestic looking historical buildings.</p>
<p> But one monument that makes it a cherished destination for most tourists, 
is the elegant century old edifice known as Mungo Park House, just a 
stone throw away from the architectural modern masterpiece of Grand 
Hotel: an amazing brief sequence of the old and the new.</p>

<h2>OSOSO TOURIST CENTRE</h2> 
<p> Ososo tourist centre offers one a rare opportunity. That opportunity 
    is having a spectacular view of two states in Nigeria. Ososo is a 
    hilly and rocky town. It is located on the boundary between Edo and 
    Kogi states. The centre has a rest house at the top of Ososo hill.</p>
